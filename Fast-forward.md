Fast-forwarding
---

```
Fast forwarding moves the currently checked out commit to one that was added later, 
replaying all commits in between in the order which they happened.

```

```
To fast-forward your currently checked out commit, you can right click on the branch with newer commits, 
and select the Fast-Forward option from the menu.

```
